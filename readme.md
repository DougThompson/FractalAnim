# Fractal Animation #

## Overview ##
**Fractal Animation** is an application that create simple AVI animations of a Plasma/Cloud type "fractal" and of [Mandelbrot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)/[Julia Set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set)/[Biomorph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickover_stalk) fractals.  This only sets a start and end point, at the moment, so the tool is a bit limited.

## Development Requirements ##
Visual Studio 2010, C#, .NET Framework 3.5.

## TODO (not in any particular order ;) ) ##
* Add code comments
* Add user settable number of frames
* Add multiple way-points
* Add undo/redo to walk the zoom history
* Explore why the animations seem to speed up at high zoom levels
* User-definable video dimensions
